- [ ] Update testing environments
- [ ] Set up CI/CD pipelines
- [ ] Update deployment scripts

**Key Tasks:**
- Configure local Citrea node
- Update environment variables
- Set up staging environments
- Update GitHub Actions
- Configure monitoring tools

### Phase 6: Testing & Quality Assurance
**Timeline: 2-3 days**
**Effort: 40-60 hours**

- [ ] Comprehensive integration testing

## Success Metrics

### Technical Performance
- [ ] Bundle size reduction: 15-25%
- [ ] Page load time improvement: 20-30%
- [ ] Transaction success rate: >95%
- [ ] API response time: <500ms

### User Experience
- [ ] Simplified onboarding flow
- [ ] Reduced click-to-trade time
- [ ] Improved mobile experience
- [ ] Zero network switching errors

### Business Outcomes
- [ ] User engagement maintenance: >90%
- [ ] Trading volume retention: >85%
- [ ] New user acquisition improvement
- [ ] Support ticket reduction: 40%

## Risk Mitigation

### High-Risk Items
- Contract deployment failures
- Token liquidity issues  
- User migration resistance
- Performance regressions

### Mitigation Strategies
- Thorough testing on testnets
- Gradual user migration
- Comprehensive rollback plans
- Performance monitoring

## Team Requirements

**Recommended Team:**
- 2-3 Senior Frontend Developers
- 1 Smart Contract Developer
- 1 DevOps Engineer
- 1 QA Engineer

**Total Estimated Effort:**
- 300-400 developer hours
- 18-22 working days
- 4-6 week timeline

## Dependencies

### Critical Path Dependencies
- Citrea mainnet stability
- Protocol contract deployments
- Token ecosystem development
- Infrastructure partnerships

### External Dependencies
- Block explorer functionality
- RPC provider reliability
- Oracle price feeds
- Wallet integration support

## Rollback Plan

### Emergency Rollback Triggers
- >50% increase in transaction failures
- Critical security vulnerability
- Major user experience regression
- Performance degradation >30%

### Rollback Process
1. Immediate revert to multi-chain version
2. User communication via status page
3. Issue assessment and resolution
4. Gradual re-migration when stable

## Post-Migration Tasks
